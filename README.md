# Single Track Mind

Don't you just _love_ Spotify? Yeah, me too. Don't you just _hate_ how it has no fricken 'repeat track' mode?

Well, no longer! This app solves the problem by giving you a "Rawk Onwards" button which will repeat any track you play indefinitely.

At the moment, it's pretty much proof of concept and probably has a few bugs. It could likely do with some decent UI design too.

# Usage
To use this, follow the steps below:

* Enable our account as a developer account
* Put the files into: `My Documents\Spotify\singletrackmind` for Windows, `~/Spotify/singletrackmind` for Linux/Mac
* Open Spotify
* Type spotify:app:singletrackmind in the search bar & press enter
* Start rawking on! And on.. and on..... xD
